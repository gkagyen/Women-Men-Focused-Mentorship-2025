## Group Project 2 – Analysing and Reporting Insights from a Dataset

### Learning Objectives:

-   Apply data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis techniques from previous sessions
-   Perform clustering, PCA, or regression analysis on a real-world dataset
-   Interpret and present findings using Quarto for reporting

## Session Outline

### 1. Introduction to Group Project

**Project Objective**

Each group will:

1.  **Choose a dataset** (From the provided data)
2.  **Preprocess the data** (handle missing values, normalize, etc.)
3.  **Apply analysis techniques** (PCA, clustering, regression, etc.)
4.  **Create visualizations** **and customise** using `ggplot2`
5.  **Compile findings into a Quarto report**

**Datasets to Choose From:**

-   **Student Performance data** – Use clustering to identify groups
-   **Top 100 tiktokers data** – Perform PCA and regression analysis

### 6. Group Presentations

Each group will present:

1.  **The cleaned dataset** – How they handled missing values and normalization.

2.  **EDA insights** – Trends, correlations, and summary statistics.

3.  **Advanced analysis** – PCA, clustering, or regression models used.

4.  **Visualizations** – Any plots that support their conclusions.

5.  **Key takeaways** – Summary of findings and recommendations.

### 8. Recap and Q&A

-   Recap key skills: EDA, PCA, clustering, and regression.
-   Discuss challenges and insights from the project.
