### Learning Objectives:

-   Understand the purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
-   Perform EDA using R to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships in data
-   Use correlation and covariance to analyse relationships between variables
-   Visualize insights through scatter plots and correlation heat maps
-   Understand the concept and purpose of hypothesis testing
-   Perform common hypothesis tests in R, such as t-tests and chi-square tests
-   Interpret the results of hypothesis tests to make data-driven decisions

## Session Outline

### 1. Introduction to EDA

**What is EDA?**\
EDA is the process of analysing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods.

**Why is EDA important?**

-   Helps understand data structure and identify patterns
-   Detects outliers and anomalies
-   Guides feature selection for modelling

**EDA Process Overview:**

1.  Summarize the data (e.g., descriptive statistics).
2.  Identify relationships between variables (e.g., correlation, scatter plots).
3.  Detect discrepancies in data.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics Recap

-   Use the `summary()` function to quickly summarize data:

    ``` r
    summary(mtcars)
    ```

-   Grouped summaries with `dplyr`:

    ``` r
    library(dplyr) 

    grouped_summary <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>%    
      summarize(     
        mean_mpg = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE),     
        sd_mpg = sd(mpg, na.rm = TRUE)   
        ) 
    print(grouped_summary) 
    ```

**Hands-on Exercise:**

-   Summarize the `iris` dataset, grouping by `Species` to calculate the mean and standard deviation of `Sepal.Length`.

### 3. Correlation and Covariance

**What is Correlation?**

Measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. Correlation coefficient (`-1` to `1`):

-   `-1`: Perfect negative relationship
-   `0`: No relationship
-   `1`: Perfect positive relationship

**What is Covariance?**

Measures how two variables vary together. Negative value indicates variables change differently. A positive value shows variables increase together.

**Calculating Correlation and Covariance in R**

1.  **Correlation**

    ``` r
    cor(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt) 
    ```

2.  **Covariance**

    ``` r
    cov(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$wt)
    ```

3.  **Correlation Matrix**

    ``` r
    cor_matrix <- cor(mtcars) 
    print(cor_matrix)
    ```

**Visualizing Correlation Matrix (Heat map)**

``` r
library(ggcorrplot) 

ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", lab = TRUE)
```

**Hands-on Exercise:**

-   Compute the correlation between `hp` and `wt` in the `mtcars` dataset.

-   Create a correlation matrix for the numeric variables in the `iris` dataset.

### 4. Visualizing Relationships (Scatter Plots)

-   **Scatter Plot:**

    ``` r
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +     
      geom_point(color = "blue") +     
      labs(title = "Scatter Plot of MPG vs Weight", 
           x = "Weight", y = "Miles per Gallon") +     
      theme_bw()
    ```

-   **Adding a Trend Line:**

    ``` r
    ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +     
      geom_point(color = "blue") +     
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red") +     
      labs(title = "Scatter Plot with Trend Line", 
           x = "Weight", y = "Miles per Gallon") +     
      theme_bw()
    ```

**Hands-on Exercise:**

-   Create a scatter plot for `hp` vs `mpg` in the `mtcars` dataset, adding a trend line.
-   Create a scatter plot for `Sepal.Length` vs `Petal.Length` in the `iris` dataset, grouped by `Species`.

### 5. Introduction to Hypothesis Testing

-   **What is Hypothesis Testing?**\
    Hypothesis testing is a statistical method to evaluate assumptions about a population based on sample data.

-   **Key Terms:**

    -   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** No significant difference or relationship exists.
    -   **Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):** A significant difference or relationship exists.
    -   **p-value:** The probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true.
        -   If `p-value < 0.05`, reject H₀ (significant result).

-   **Types of Hypothesis Tests:**

    -   Parametric: Assume data follows a specific distribution (example, t-tests).

    -   Non-parametric: No distributional assumptions (example, chi-square test).

### 6. t-Test

**1-Sample t-Test**

-   Used to compare the mean of a sample to a known value:

    ``` r
    # Example: Is the mean mpg significantly different from 20?   

    t_test_1s <- t.test(mtcars$mpg, mu = 20)   
    print(t_test_1s) 
    ```

**2-Sample t-Test**

-   Used to compare the means of two independent groups:

    ``` r
    # Example: Compare mpg between cars with 4 and 6 cylinders

    t_test_2s <- t.test(mpg ~ factor(cyl), 
                        data = mtcars, 
                        subset = cyl %in% c(4, 6))   
    print(t_test_2s)
    ```

**Paired t-Test**

-   Used when measurements are taken on the same subject before and after a treatment:

    ``` r
    # Example: Hypothetical pre-test and post-test scores   
    pre_test <- c(80, 85, 78, 90)   
    post_test <- c(88, 87, 82, 95)   
    paired_test <- t.test(pre_test, post_test, paired = TRUE)   

    print(paired_test) 
    ```

**Hands-on Exercise:**

-   Perform a 1-sample t-test to check if the average horsepower (`hp`) of `mtcars` is significantly different from 150.
-   Perform a 2-sample t-test comparing `mpg` between cars with 4 and 8 cylinders.

### 7. Chi-Square Test

-   Used to test the association between two categorical variables.

**Chi-Square Test of Independence**

``` r
# Example: Test if the distribution of cyl is independent of gear   
chisq_table <- table(mtcars$cyl, mtcars$gear)   
chi_test <- chisq.test(chisq_table)   
print(chi_test)
```

**Hands-on Exercise:**

-   Use the `mtcars` dataset to test if `cyl` (cylinders) is independent of `am` (transmission type).

### 8. Interpreting Results

**Key Interpretation Points:**

-   Check the p-value:

    -   `p-value < 0.05`: Reject the null hypothesis (significant result).

    -   `p-value >= 0.05`: Fail to reject the null hypothesis (no significant result).

-   Review confidence intervals for additional insights.

### 6. Interactive Group Activity

**Group Challenge:**

-   Use the `iris` dataset and:

    1.  Compute the correlation matrix for all numeric variables.

    2.  Visualize the matrix using `ggcorrplot`.

    3.  Create a scatter plot of `Sepal.Width` vs `Petal.Width`, grouped by `Species`.

    4.  Perform 1 sample t-test to check if the average `Petal.Length` is significantly different from 4

    5.  Perform a 2 sample t-test to check if the average Petal.Length of `virginica` is significantly different from `Setosa`

**Solutions for Group Challenge:**

``` r
# 1. Correlation Matrix   
cor_matrix_iris <- cor(iris[, 1:4]) print(cor_matrix_iris)  

# 2. Heatmap   
ggcorrplot(cor_matrix_iris, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", lab = TRUE)  

# 3. Scatter Plot   
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Width, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +     
  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of Sepal Width vs Petal Width",          
       x = "Sepal Width", y = "Petal Width") +     
  theme_minimal() 

# 4 1-sample t-test
t1_petal.length <- t.test(iris$Petal.Length, mu=4)
print(t1_petal.length)

# 5 2-sample t-test
t2_PL_Species <- t.test(Petal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
                        subset = Species %in% c('setosa', 'virginica'))
print(t2_PL_Species)
```

### 9. Assignment

```

**2. Scatter Plot with Trend Line:**

``` r

  labs(title = "Scatter Plot of HP vs Weight", x = "Horsepower", y = "Weight") +  
  theme_classic()  

ggcorrplot(cor_matrix,             
           hc.order = TRUE,             
           type = "lower",             
           lab = TRUE) 
```

**3. t-Test:**

``` r
t_test_1s_wt <- t.test(mtcars$wt, mu = 3)

t_test_2s_hp <- t.test(hp ~ am, data = mtcars)   
print(t_test_2s_hp)   # Output: Compare p-value and means for interpretation   
```

**4. Chi-Square**

``` r
# Create a discretized version of Sepal.Length   
iris$Sepal.Length.Discrete <- ifelse(iris$Sepal.Length > median(iris$Sepal.Length), "High", "Low")    

# Create contingency table and perform chi-square test   
iris_table <- table(iris$Species, iris$Sepal.Length.Discrete)   
iris_chi_test <- chisq.test(iris_table)   
print(iris_chi_test)   # Output: Check p-value for independence   
```
